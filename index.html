      <h2>Dear Rui,</h2>
      <p>
        I'm so glad I met you! This year has been so fun being your girlfriend,
        I hope I can continue being your partner in the future <3 You're such a
        sweet guy, I find it hard to believe I met a sweet, amazing, cute and
        handsome boy online (on Overwatch 2 at that)! I wish we could have met
        in better ways on conditions, but that doesn’t make me love you any
        less. You made me so loved from day 1, and you inspire me to do better.
        Thanks to you, I eat better and take better care of my health, I’m not
        as shy anymore to try new clothes and I feel really pretty nowadays
        thanks to you my love. I love talking to you, especially when we laugh a
        lot or when it’s about our future together! <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        I can’t wait to meet you baby, I wanna kiss you a whole lot! I really
        love it when you’re overwhelmingly sweet to me, I feel so loved and
        you’re such a sweet boy, I’m so happy to be loved by a cute boy like
        you! I hope you know you’re my type, I agree I wasn’t into white boys,
        but I’m actually so in love with you that it went away completely. I
        love how you have cats, the way they’re clingy to you shows how well you
        treat them and how good of a person you are <3 I love that you have many
        close friends, it turned you into the person you are today and that's
        the one I fell in love with! I’m really glad you love me back, you turn
        my insecurities into aspects that I find lovable in myself. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I really love your laugh and your smile, that honestly might be my
        favorite parts about you! When we met, the most I could see on call was
        your neck and underneath, but that slowly changed to seeing your lips as
        well. When you’d give me hand cams when I asked, the camera slipped a
        bit and I saw your face. I didn’t say anything, because I didn’t want
        you to get embarrassed, so I acted like I didn’t notice. You looked so
        cute when I first saw you, and seeing your full face lately makes me so
        happy. You’re genuinely so adorable and handsome, I didn’t know it was
        possible to be so full of love for someone, even if they’re across the
        world from me. The first videos you sent me also made me really happy, I
        kept rewatching them on repeat. Ever since I fell in love with you, I
        completely lost interest in others romantically (which is good and
        normal of course), but it’s gotten to the point where everyone is really
        unattractive and I’ve started to question if I’m still bisexual. <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll start listing the points I love the most about you! Your downturned
        eyes are so pretty, I love the colour and shape. I’m kinda jealous of
        your eyelashes, but I just hope our child will inherit them! Your
        slightly hollow inner eyes look so good, I try to do that with makeup to
        highlight my own eyes, so your pretty eyes end up standing out more. I
        know most white people have that too, but your red cheeks are really
        adorable. It gives life to your complexion and you sometimes look like
        you’re blushing, which I find cute! You have a big nose, but it makes
        your face masculine and compliments you really well. I like how we both
        have a big nose (which was once an insecurity) and thick eyebrows. I
        adore your whole face, and your straight eyebrows look really nice! I
        think our future child will for sure have a big nose and thick eyebrows.
        Of course once again, my favorite part is your lips! When you smile, my
        heart always beats really fast, even now. When you smile and I can only
        see your lips, you look really hot and attractive, but when I see your
        whole face while you do, you look so adorable. I can see your cheeks
        rise up and the hotness is gone, it’s just a purely adorable face that
        you have on. I love how your lips are naturally pink colored, which is
        honestly the shade of the lippie you got me! They’re very juicy as well
        and I’d love to feel them on mine one day <3 <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now for personality wise, I love how we both have stupid humour. I’m
        glad you entertain my stupid jokes and how easily you can make me laugh.
        I’m happy you understand me well, despite my rambling being literally
        incomprehensible. When I’m excited, I talk really fast, so I constantly
        have that habit with you. When I clip some moments with you, you sound
        so gentle and understanding with me while I don’t even sound like I’m
        speaking English. I also love the voice messages you leave me, I love
        how sweet and comforting your voice is. <br />
      </p>
      <p>To finish this, I want to say I really hope we get married and spend our lives together <3 I love you the most Rui my love, mwah! Mwah mwah mwahh....</p>
